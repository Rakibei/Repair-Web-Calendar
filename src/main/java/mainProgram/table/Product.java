/* --- Product Class --- */
// Represents a product in the system
// This entity is mapped to the "products" table in the database.
// Each Product can be linked to multiple JobParts (via one-to-many relationship).
@Entity // Marks this class as a JPA entity (maps to a database table)
@Table(name = "products") // Explicitly sets the table name in the database
public class Product {

    // Attributes
    @Id // Marks this field as the table's primary key
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) // Assumes serial/bigserial PK
    private int id; // Maps to: id (Generated by Default as Identity)

    @Column(name = "\"productNumber\"")
    private String productNumber; // Maps to: productNumber (Not product_number)

    private String name; // Maps to: name

    @JsonProperty("EAN") // Ensures Jackson matches the JSON key "EAN" (with uppercase letters)
    @Column(name = "\"EAN\"")
    private String EAN; // Maps to: EAN (Not ean) in the database

    @Column(name = "category")
    private String type; // Maps to: category (Not type) in the database

    private Double price; // Maps to: price

    // One-to-Many Relationship: One Product can be associated with many JobParts.
    /**
     * @mappedBy "product"
     * Indicates that the JobPart entity owns the relationship
     * through its "product" field. This makes it a bidirectional
     * relationship where JobPart has the foreign key.
     *
     * @cascade CascadeType.ALL
     * All JPA operations (persist, merge, remove, refresh, detach)
     * performed on this Product will cascade to associated JobParts.
     * EXAMPLE: Deleting a Product will also delete all its JobParts.
     *
     * @orphanRemoval true
     * If a JobPart is removed from this list, it will be automatically
     * deleted from the database. This ensures no orphaned JobPart records
     * exist without a parent Product.
